# Rotaty
Rotaty is my iPhone Jailbreak tweak that is supposed to rotate your icons to a random degree. Right now I am having some trouble compiling this tweak and only can get all of the icons to be rotated to a specified degree. What I need is for random icons to be rotated to a random degree. I have this open-sourced because this is my first tweak and I believe other developers could probably fix issues I cannot.
